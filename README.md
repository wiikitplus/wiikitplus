my name is **kit**! im 19 i use she/her pronouns but like in a genderfluid way. no they/them please! i am a lover of many things... but right now i am particularly into wicked and katseye! i love gelphie (*i am very like weirdly mentally and emotionally attached to galinda though*) and i am a lara bias, but ultimately am ot6 :3!!! i like five million other things just feel free to ask me if they aren't listed in my txto page. im always happy to talk interests!


i made this page for fun, but i usually only am on ponytown when my friends are online. feel free to strike up a chat with me (im a friendly gal! i do not bite i promise) but i may be afk or focused on other things, and i do struggle to START conversations sometimes. feel free to whisper whenever though! 
also must mention that im in the tadc area a lot? but not as a tadc pony? i fear im not really into it like oomfs but im like an ever-binding leech and i stay there for fun. so if you see lara from katseye hanging out with the digital circus... do not be alarmed


dni proship/darkship whatever, if you like generally received weird things (BTD go away, hazbin hotel preferably go away but like idgaf that much, etc etc etc so on and so forth), and also? if you are an avid fiyeraba fan... please go away!


thank you for reading!! happy ponytown-ing!
